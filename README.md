# Breakout-Ball
A java project for the game Breakout Ball with UI and score.

This is a java project with 3 classes that creates the original game: Breakout Ball.

After you run the main method, the frame with the game will appear to your screen.

The game will start after pressing the SPACE Key on the keyboard. The goal is to break all the bricks with the ball.

At the top right is the score. Every brick add 5 points. After winning or losing, if you press SPACE you will replay the game.

Every time you play the rows and the columns of the bricks (the amount of the bricks) will be random.

For more information about how the code works, there are lots of comments in the .java files to help you understand everything and follow along with ease!
